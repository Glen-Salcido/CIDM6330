# Increasing Access to Healthcare in Rural Communities through Telehealth

## Front Matter
Lack of healthcare in Rural Commonities
### Front Page
Access to healthcare in rural communities is a significant challenge, with residents often facing long travel, a shortage of healthcare providers, and limited medical facilities. These are just some of the barriers that lead to delayed diagnoses, untreated conditions, and overall lower health outcomes.

## Requirements Statements
### User Stories
Edith is a 69-year old retiree living in a rural community with a population of less than 130 people with limited healthcare access. She lacks a reliable way to receive medical consultations and treamtents without treveling 70 miles to the neartest primary care clinic. She does have access to internet at home but it is not broadband and not reliable in the least. She manages her health conditions effectively and maintains good quality of life, but refilling her perciptions requires her to see her doctor in person necesitating travel. 

Joe, an 80-year-old retiree with mobility issues living in a rural community 30 miles away from the nearest clinic needs a reliable way to receive monthly medical consultations and treatmens for diabetes and hypertension without having to travel. He has no stable internet connection and has to call EMS everytime he needs a clinic visit since he is unable to travel himself. He has been in contact with services to help him move closer to the clinic or a more accessible home for his mobility issues but has been unable to follow up with them.

### Use Cases 
For Edith the best case would be to make sure she had reliable broadband internet through her phone or computer to be able to hop on a Telehealth call with her primary care provider to get a refill of her prectiptions as needed. 

For Joe best case would be to relocate closer to medical facilities that could be helpful to him telehealth visits would not be applicable to his advanced medical needs.

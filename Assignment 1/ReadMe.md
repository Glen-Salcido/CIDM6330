# Increasing Access to Healthcare in Rural Communities through Telehealth

## Front Matter
Lack of healthcare in Rural Commonities
### Front Page
Access to healthcare in rural communities is a significant challenge, with residents often facing long travel, a shortage of healthcare providers, and limited medical facilities. These are just some of the barriers that lead to delayed diagnoses, untreated conditions, and overall lower health outcomes.
### 1. Introduction
My name is Glen Salcido and I am a Program Manger currently trying to figure out a possible way to help rural communites using Telehealth initatives to better serve the communites. Through this model we will address the issues at hand a have some features that could be used to address this issue.

## 2. Requirements Statements
### 2.1 User Stories
Edith, a 69-year-old retiree living in a rural community with a population of less than 130 people with limited healthcare access. I lack a reliable way to receive medical consultations and treamtents without treveling 70 miles to the neartest primary care clinic. I do have access to internet at home but it is not broadband and not reliable in the least. I manage my health conditions effectively and maintain a good quality of life, but refilling my preciptions requires me to see my doctor in person necessitating travel. I need a way to book a visit remotely for my convenience and to reduce my travel.

Joe, an 80-year-old retiree with mobility issues living in a rural community 30 miles away from the nearest clinic needs a reliable way to receive monthly medical consultations and treatmens for diabetes and hypertension without having to travel. I have no stable internet connection and I call EMS everytime I needs a clinic visit since I unable to travel. I have been in contact with services to help move closer to the clinic or to a more accessible home for my mobility issues but I have been unable to follow up with them.

Mary, a 22-year-old 14 weeks pregnant in a rural community with no access to pre-natal care or a women's clinic to help with her pregnancy. I have been seen via Telemedicine multiple times to get advise and counseling but I am unable to get access to a OBGYN to care for my pregnancy. I can't seem to get in contact with the office or they will not see me with a prior visit and I need to get an ultrasound to check on the status of my pregnancy. I want to be able to send my health data to the clinic to be able to be seen. I can travel if needed. 

### 2.2 Use Cases 
- For Edith the best case would be to make sure she had reliable broadband internet through her phone or computer to be able to hop on a Telehealth call with her primary care provider to get a refill of her prectiptions as needed. 

- For Joe best case would be to relocate closer to medical facilities that could be helpful to him telehealth visits would not be applicable to his advanced medical needs. 

- For Mary the OBGYN clinic has none of her health records and have not been able to get her scheduled if the records were transmitted and they were reviewed they would be able to schedule her for an appointment and even book a telemedicine visit to get a face to face with a OBGYN.

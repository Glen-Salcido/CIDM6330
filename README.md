## _Increasing Access to Healthcare in Rural Communities through Telehealth_
### Problem
Access to healthcare in rural communities is a significant challenge, with residents often facing long travel, a shortage of healthcare providers, and limited medical facilities. These are just some of the barriers that lead to delayed diagnoses, untreated conditions, and overall lower health outcomes.
### Domain
This problem is situated within the healthcare domain, specifically focussing on the use of telehealth to improve healthcare access. Telehealth involves the use of digital information and communication technologies, such as comupters and mobile devices to manage health remotely.
### Personal Interest
I currently work as a Program Manager at Texas Tech University Health Science Center, I am currently utilizing grant money to address this issue. My professional role involves overseeing projects aimed at improving healthcare access, and I am passionate about using technology to create better solutions. 
Personally, I want to enhance the quality of life for the rural communities and I hope Telehealth offers a viable pathway to achieving this goal. I'm working on my Master's Degree to get more knowledge and training with data analytics to collect better data and organize it in a presentable way to further improve access to care and to receive additional grant money to roll out bigger and better programs to help more communities.
### Proposed System
I beleive that using data analytics from demographics in the region, access to telehealth equipment, broadband, and over health status would be a great to understand the needs and then leverage a telehealth system tailored to this communities to help increase the access to care. All of the electronic health records are protected data that would be required to form forecasts to which methods are projected to work and which need to improved or switched to better technology. 
A system that collects all this data and inputing into a repository to allow Program Managers like myself to identify the needs of the rural communties. Perhaps one just lacks a primary care clinic or they have the infrastructure in place but no providers are available. If that data becomes easily viewable you could perhaps work with a Medical School to provide rotating students/residents/doctors to these locations to improve the access to care. Perhaps set up telehealth equpiment and teach them how to reach out to bigger health hubs to have Telehealh visits and scheduled in advance. Using software like Tableau to visualize outcomes of these could be presented to the grant commities to improve funding to this projects.
